# AI-Research-Project

For my project, I had to work on the Chess Data Set with the purpose of finding the model that would be best for classification into "win" and "no-win" categories. I used PyCaret to be able to go through all of the possible models and choose the best-fitting one. In my initial research, I found that the two possible options were the Decision Tree Classifier and the Light Gradient Boosting Machine Model. But after an in-depth analysis of the results with the test data sets and the plots, it was determined that the Light Gradient Boosting Machine Model was the best choice for this data set.
